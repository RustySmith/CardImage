Project to explore placing an image in a window for use with my solitaire project.
This is an MFC SDI app with document/view support.

I want to create a child to the View window, and put a card image in the child window.

I had some trouble creating the child window. apparently, an OnPaint handler has to exist, even if it does nothing.
The child window is drawn now.

I added code to Card::OnPaint() to load a bitmapped image, but it is not loading.
The image is in a .png file. Does it need to be a .bmp file? Nope.
LoadBitmapW() returns 0.
If I use the resource symbol value instead of the resource symbol name, LoadBitmapW() returns 1.
Now I think SelectObject() is not working.
I can use a pen to draw a line.

I am trying to load the card bitmap in View. The dimensions of the card are smaller than the view. The bitmap loads, but I can't select it. SelectObject() returns 0.

CDC::SelectObject info:
An application can select a bitmap into memory device contexts only and into only one memory device context at a time.
I guess I need to figure out how to use CDC::BitBlt() to copy from memory into the active device context.
Done.

Card::LoadBmp() successfully loads the bitmap image, but the Card window is smaller than the image, and only a portion of the card image shows in the window.
I have no idea how to resize a .bmp resource to fit the window.
The image disappears if I resize the View.

To ENABLE the Disassembly window, under Tools > Options > Debugging, select Enable address-level debugging. To OPEN the Disassembly window during debugging, I RIGHT-CLICKED on the active window while halted at a breakpoint, and selected Go To Disassembly, A Disassembly tab opened.

I moved some code from Card::LoadBitmap() to Card::OnPaint() to see if I could get the image to repaint.
I am going to eliminate Card::LoadBitmap() and do everything in Card::OnPaint().
Doesn't draw the card image.
When I did CDC::BitBlt() before calling OnPaint(), it worked once. It seemed that subsequent calls to OnPaint() didn't work. Now, with everyting in OnPaint, it doesn't work at all.

Should Card be derived from CView instead of CWnd? No. A CView is attached to a document, and has a frame.

I got the card image to draw in View::OnDraw(). It can even change size as the window size changes. Now why doesn't it work in Card::OnPaint?
I put the code in OnPaint(), and it is working.
